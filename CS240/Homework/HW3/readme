The Q1 program returns a unordered sorted list of even and odd numbers from a series of unordered inputs from standard input. It first take the user standard input and
then traverses through the array finding even and odd numbers using the modulo expression `arr[i] % 2 == 0`. From this expression, the program will determine if the value at
`arr[i]` will go into either the `even[]` array or the `odd[]` array.

The Q2 program returns the number of duplicates from a series of unordered inputs from standard input. It looks at the current index and loops to check for a duplicate. The logic
behind this is that if there was a duplicate value before the current index, then it would not increment the `duplicate_num` value as that had already been checked beforehand using
the `duplicates[]` array.

the Q3 program returns a unordered sorted list of unique occurrences of values from a series of unordered inputs from standard input. It uses two loops to check for duplicates in
front and behind the current indexed value. It will then put the unique occurrences of values into the `unique[]` array and then print out its values.
