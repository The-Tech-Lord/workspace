For question one, I did a more static approach where I just decided to hard code all the vowels and consonants, capital and lowercase, as for some reason doing the charater
arithmetic was not working. In the second question, I simply implemented the bubble sort algorithm for both ascending and descending sorting orders. I also accounted for when the
user inputs a wrong or unaccepted input for choosing the order.
