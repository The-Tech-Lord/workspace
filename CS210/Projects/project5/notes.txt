1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical
   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.

   Project 5 has the student start programming a tree-based symbol table and learning how to use various types of data to create a symbol table that can effectively accept any type
   of data you give it (as long as it's the type of data that you defined in the data structure).

2. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS210 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

   Name               Status       Help Received
   ----               ------       -------------

   ...                ...          ...

3. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   I have no idea why the `puts` method from RedBlackBST is removing elements. I even decompiled the code to see how the code worked.
