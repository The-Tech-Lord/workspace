1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical
   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.

   The Autocomplete project shows a naive implementation of more sophisticated autocomplete programs provided by larger companies.
   Though it's a naive implementation, it gives surface-level insight of how autocomplete works.

2. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS210 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

   Name               Status       Help Received
   ----               ------       -------------

   ...                ...          ...

3. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   The project was pretty fun to make. Wasn't too difficult but still made good use of Java concepts.
   And yes, the code in Autocomplete.java is a bit sacrilegious.
