1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical
   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.

   The project makes the student get more comfortable with using Interfaces as well as creating data structures to manipulate
   and contain various types of data. It also introduces the student to start thinking about possible corner cases, even if they seem like they may never be checked and appear
   unnecessary.

2. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS210 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

   Name               Status       Help Received
   ----               ------       -------------

   ...                ...          ...

3. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   Learning about how the For-Each loop worked helped with wondering how I needed to use the Iterator and Iterable interfaces. I'd say it was quite enjoyable but then I realized that
   corner cases exist lol.
