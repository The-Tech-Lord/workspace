1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical
   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.

   Project 4 has the student program an elementary search and solve algorithm that will be applicable in more advanced settings
   such as game development or any STEM field, if of course refined and made more sophisticated. Some parts of this project
   maybe also provoke a need to have some math knowledge to implement a more efficient algorithm.

2. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS210 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

   Name               Status       Help Received
   ----               ------       -------------

   ...                ...          ...

3. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   Figuring out some math in this project was quite fun actually. Wasn't too hard but challenging enough that it can stick with you.
   Also, dang those silly mistakes can really cost you xd
