1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical
   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.

   Creating the Mozart Waltz generator has the student utilize all the skills that were taught and acquired
   regarding chapter 1 of the textbook. It allows the student to get a better feel of what real world projects
   can be capable of and what they may be when getting into the work force.

2. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS110 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

   Name               Status       Help Received
   ----               ------       -------------

   ...                ...          ...

3. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   The inputs felt weird from how C would do it, though it was an interesting experience learning how Python
   inputs/outputs work.
