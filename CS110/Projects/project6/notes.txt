1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical
   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.

   Project 6, the Markov Model, introduces the student to implementing statistical computations into their programs. This will start to prepare the student for more advanced topics
   such as ML/AI or other fields that are statistics intensive.

2. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS110 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

   Name               Status       Help Received
   ----               ------       -------------

   ...                ...          ...

3. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   Using the Python interpreter in the terminal is a great tool for testing code snippets. It also made me try out some ideas I thought would maybe not work, but ended up working.
