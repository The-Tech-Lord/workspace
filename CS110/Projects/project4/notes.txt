1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical
   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.

   The RSA Cryptography project has the student get a feel for what it is like to create their
   own library or manage one. It has the student try out different forms of input that can either
   go character by character or read the entire paragraph of input one has provided.

2. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS110 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

   Name               Status       Help Received
   ----               ------       -------------

   ...                ...          ...

3. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   Realizing stdio.readAll() existed was a godsend
