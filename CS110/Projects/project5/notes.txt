1. Provide a high-level description (ie, using minimal amount of technical
   jargon) of the project in no more than 200 words.

   Project5, Atomic Nature of Matter, makes the student start interacting with more types of inputs, this project
   emphasizing images now. Tracking molecules in water across a chain of images using a much more simplified method
   than what is used in the scientific field.

2. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS110 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

3. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   Running average equation was painful to implement. More than necessary. I love computer science.
